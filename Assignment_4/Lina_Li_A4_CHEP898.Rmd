# Assignment Introduction

**Assignment Goal:** Work with the Can Path Student Dataset to perform a Random Forest analysis, conduct detailed hyperparameter tuning, and compare the performance of your model with other models or configurations. This exercise emphasizes building robust models and evaluating their performance critically.


**Assignment Objectives:**

-  Develop proficiency in implementing Random Forest algorithms for predictive analysis.

- Understand the importance of hyperparameter tuning and its impact on model performance.

- Gain experience in comparing models to select the best-performing configuration.

- Learn to interpret Random Forest results, including feature importance.
