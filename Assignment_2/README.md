**10% of Final Grade**

## Description
This assignment is designed to familiarize you with version control using Git and GitHub, essential tools for collaborative and professional workflows in data science and software development. By the end of this assignment, you will have hands-on experience setting up a GitHub account, installing Git, creating and managing a GitHub repository, and performing basic Git operations. This assignment will mostly follow the *Happy Git with R* tutorial with a few twists and turns along the way.

## Assignment Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:
- Create and configure a GitHub account to manage and share your projects.
- Install Git on your local computer and connect it with GitHub.
- Understand the process of version control, including committing, pushing, and pulling changes.
- Submit a pull request to the class repository and post a gif.

## Assignment Tasks

### Set Up GitHub
1. Create a GitHub account if you do not already have one.
2. Personalize your account by adding a profile picture and a short bio.

### Install Git
1. Install Git on your local computer.
2. Configure Git with your name and email using the `usethis` package.

### Create a GitHub Repository
1. Log in to GitHub and create a new public repository.
2. Name the repository descriptively (e.g., "Intro-to-GitHub-Assignment").

### Clone and Set Up the Repository
1. Clone your repository to your local computer using an RStudio project.
2. Add a `README.md` file to your local repository. Use it to describe the purpose of the repository.

### Commit and Push Changes
1. Take your `data_wrangling` assignment and commit and push it to the GitHub repository you just created.
2. Stage your changes, commit them with meaningful messages, and push them to your GitHub repository.
3. Verify that the changes appear correctly on your GitHub repository.

### Clone the Class GitHub Assignment Repo and Submit a Pull Request
1. Clone the class repository into a new RStudio project.
2. Edit the GitHub Assignment repository by adding a gif that represents your experience with this assignment.
3. Submit a pull request with the proposed edit to the repository.

## Deliverables
Submit a document (any format) with the following links:
- **GitHub Repository Link**: Link to your public GitHub repository where all assignment components (1 through 5) are stored.
- **Repository Contents**:
  - A properly formatted `README.md` file describing the repository and your experience.
  - At least one committed and pushed file (in addition to the `README.md`) to demonstrate your ability to track changes.
- **Gif**:
  - Submit a pull request to add your gif before the deadline.
