# Assignment 1 Description: Data Wrangling and Visualization

## Value
**10% of Final Grade**

## Description
This assignment focuses on foundational data wrangling techniques and the ability to effectively clean, analyze, and visualize data. You will work with real-world datasets to practice essential skills in data preparation, exploration, and integration. Your goal is to transform raw datasets into a format ready for analysis, draw meaningful insights using descriptive statistics, and present findings visually.

## Assignment Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:
- Develop skills in cleaning and preprocessing raw data, including handling inconsistent data.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis using descriptive statistics.
- Integrate multiple datasets by performing joins and ensuring consistency in the merged data.
- Create meaningful visualizations to summarize and communicate your findings.

## Assignment Tasks

### Data Cleaning
- Load the provided datasets and examine their structure (e.g., columns, data types, unique values).
- Identify and correct issues such as outliers, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.

### Joining Datasets
- Combine the two related datasets by performing appropriate join operations (e.g., inner join, left join).
- Ensure the resulting dataset maintains consistency and completeness.

### Descriptive Statistics
- Calculate key statistics (e.g., mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation) for relevant variables.
- Identify trends or anomalies based on these statistics.

### Data Visualization
- Create at least three visualizations to highlight key findings.
- Use appropriate chart types (e.g., bar charts, scatterplots, heatmaps) and ensure clarity in labels, legends, and formatting.

## Deliverables
Submit your `.Rmd` and your knit `.html` file for the analysis. I will be running your `.Rmd` file, so please make sure your submission is executable and replicable. Remember to document your process thoroughly with descriptions in the text of the `.Rmd` file.

## Assessment Criteria
Your submission will be graded on the following:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (25%)**: Effectiveness in identifying and resolving data quality issues.
- **Descriptive Statistics and Analysis (20%)**: Appropriateness and accuracy of the statistical analysis.
- **Dataset Integration (20%)**: Correctness and clarity in joining datasets.
- **Visualizations (20%)**: Relevance, clarity, and aesthetic quality of the visualizations.
- **Documentation and Presentation (15%)**: Clear explanations, well-commented code, and professional formatting of the submission.
