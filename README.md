# Assignment Descriptions

## Data Wrangling and Visualization
**Value:** 10% of final grade  
**Description:** In this assignment, you will complete a data wrangling assignment that will involve data cleaning, descriptive statistics, understanding missing data, and joining datasets together.

## GitHub
**Value:** 10% of final grade  
**Description:** In this assignment, you will create a GitHub account, install Git on your local computer, create a GitHub repository, and commit and push your work to that GitHub repository.

## Missing Data
**Value:** 15% of final grade  
**Description:** In this assignment, you will apply and compare different methods for imputing missing data on a large health administrative dataset.

## Independent Analysis 1
**Value:** 10% of final grade  
**Description:** This is part 1 of the independent analysis. You will need to find a dataset, develop an analysis plan that includes the major components of the course (i.e., GitHub, Scientific Computing), and conduct descriptive statistics and data wrangling on your chosen dataset.

## Random Forest
**Value:** 10% of final grade  
**Description:** In this analysis, you will complete a Random Forest analysis using the Can Path student dataset. You will need to run the analysis, conduct detailed hyperparameter tuning, and conduct model comparisons.

## Scientific Computing/Big Data
**Value:** 10% of final grade  
**Description:** In this assignment, you will use the USask Plato High Performance Computing to run large-scale machine learning on a large (~1GB) dataset.

## Matching
**Value:** 15% of final grade  
**Description:** In this analysis, you will complete a machine-learning-based matching analysis using the Can Path student dataset.

## Independent Analysis 2
**Value:** 15% of final grade  
**Description:** This is part 2 (final part) of the independent analysis. You will need to conduct a complete analysis including data wrangling, missing data handling, and applying at least 2 different machine learning methods to your data.

## Self-Evaluation
**Type:** Written report  
**Description:** Complete the student self-evaluation form.

# Submitting Assignments
All assignments should be submitted to the appropriate place in Canvas or GitHub. All assignments are due at 5 PM (CST) on the due date. Please don’t stay up until midnight to get the work done. Remember there are no late penalties, so just take an extra day if you need and get some sleep.

---

# Late and Missing Assignments
There is no penalty for late assignments. However, because many assignments have two parts, it is critical to submit the first assignment of the sections around the due date. Missing assignments that are not submitted by the end of the course will receive a grade of zero.
