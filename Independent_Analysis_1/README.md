# Assignment Description: Independent Analysis - Part 1

## Value
**10% of Final Grade**

## Description
This is the first step in a multi-part independent analysis project. You will identify a dataset of your choice, develop an analysis plan incorporating key concepts from the course (e.g., GitHub, Scientific Computing), and begin your analysis by conducting data wrangling and descriptive statistics. This assignment will serve as the foundation for further in-depth exploration and analysis in subsequent parts.

## Assignment Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:
- Learn how to identify and source appropriate datasets for analysis.
- Plan and structure a data analysis project using course methodologies.
- Apply data wrangling techniques to clean and preprocess data.
- Use GitHub to track and document your work.

## Assignment Tasks

### Identify a Dataset
1. Choose a dataset relevant to your interests or field of study.
2. The dataset should have sufficient complexity (e.g., multiple variables, missing data, or the need for preprocessing).
3. Include a brief description of the dataset (source, size, and relevance) in your submission.

### Develop an Analysis Plan
1. Outline the goals of your analysis and the questions you aim to answer.
2. Include the major components of the course in your plan, such as:
   - Using GitHub to version control and document your project.
   - Applying scientific computing techniques (e.g., Python or R) for data manipulation and analysis.
3. Clearly describe the steps you plan to take, from data cleaning to reporting.

### Data Wrangling
1. Load your dataset and examine its structure.
2. Perform cleaning tasks, including handling missing data, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring appropriate data types.
3. Prepare the dataset for analysis by creating or transforming variables as necessary.

### GitHub Integration
1. Create a public or private repository on GitHub for this project.
2. Commit and push your analysis plan, cleaned dataset, and any scripts or notebooks used for wrangling and statistics.

## Deliverables

### GitHub Repository
Submit the link to your repository, ensuring it includes:
- A `README.md` file describing the project and dataset.
- Your analysis plan as a rendered `.Rmd` file.
- A `.Rmd` file used for data wrangling and descriptive statistics.

### Dataset Description
Provide a brief document or section in your `README.md` explaining the dataset, its source, and its relevance to your analysis.

### Analysis Report
- Provide a concise summary of your data wrangling steps and initial observations.
- Include visualizatio
